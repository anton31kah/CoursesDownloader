# CoursesDownloader
This script is a simple downloader for the website <courses.finki.ukim.mk>, it provides an automated way to download multiple files, it has some actions, and is constantly expanded, many features will be introduced in the future, but keep in mind that the purpose of this project was to automate the process so it should make it faster and easier and not slower and harder.

This script depends on a few packages that I'll list here in the future.
